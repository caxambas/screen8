	<b>FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS</b>

	<br><a href="http://epss.ahrq.gov/ePSS/search.jsp">Summarized from the ePSS</a><br><br>

	<b>Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. Screen once with ultrasound all men aged 65-75 who have ever smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their life.</p>

	<b>Alcohol Misuse</b>

<p>Grade B recommmendation. Speak with all adults aged 18 and older about alchol abuse and in those who misuse alcohol the USPSTF recommends "brief behavioral counseling interventions".</p>

	<b>Aspirin</b>

	<p>Grade A recommendation. All men, aged 45 to 79, should be placed on low dose ASA if the benefit of reduction of MI outweighs the risk of GI bleed.  Women are recommended to be placed on ASA from age 55 to 79 for the prevention of ischemic stroke if that benefit outweighs the risk of GI bleed. <a href="http://cvdrisk.nhlbi.nih.gov/calculator.asp">A calculator for CVD risk can be found here</a>.</p>

	<b>BRCA Testing</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. There are two screening interventions the USPSTF advocates to reduce the burden of breast cancer.  The first is to identify those patients who would benefit from genetic tessting (screening) for BRCA1 and 2.  The criteria for genetic screening are complex, and the USPSTF has a <a href="https://www.breastcancergenescreen.org/providers.aspx">calculator that can be done in clinic.</a> There is no specific upper age limit for this screening, but elderly women are definitely going to be low yield.</p>	

	<b>Breast Cancer Modifying Medication</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. The USPSTF recommends identifying those patients who would benefit from medications (such as tamoxifen) that reduce the risk of breast cancer.  In general, they recommend starting this if the 5 year risk of developing breast cancer is 3% or greater, however there are risks such as increased thromboembolism and enough caveats that it is probably more reasonable to send a patient with an increased family history of breast cancer to a cancer center with more experience if that is available in the community. A woman's estimated risk of developing breast cancer can be calculated with the National Cancer Institute's <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/">Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool.</a>Again, there is no set upper age limit by the USPSTF, however yield is going to decrease in elderly women.</p>

	<b>Cervical Cancer</b>

<p>Grade A recommendation. All women with a cervix undergo should cervical cancer screening from the age of 21 to 65. The interval of testing should be every three years when done with cytology Pap smear alone (recommended for ages 21-65), or every 5 years if done in combination with HPV testing (only if aged 30-65). However, if there is a history of cervical cancer, a high-grade precancerous lesion, immunocompromise, or in utero exposure to diethylstibestrol see ACOG recommendations for screening intervals.  Woman older than 65 who have had prior screening and are not at high risk of cervical cancer can stop screening. If a woman has had her cervix removed (as long as it wasn't for cervical cancer or high-grade lesion) there is no need to continue to screen. </p>

	<b>Chlamydia</b>

<p>Grade A recommendation. Screen all sexually active women younger than 24 years old as well as well as women older than 24 yrs old who are at increased risk.  Increased risk includes a history of STI, new or multiple sexual partners, inconsistent condom use, increased prevalence in the patient's community, or exchanging sex for money or drugs.</p>

	<b>Colorectal Cancer Screening</b>

<p>Grade A recommendation. You can use FOBT (stool cards), sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy regimens. FOBT should be done yearly, sigmoidoscopy should be done every 5 years WITH FOBT every 3 years, and colonoscopy can be done every 10 years. Each method has pretty similar efficacy so you should focus on doing what your patient will adhere to.  Patients from the age of 50 to 75 should be screened. Be aware that there are different recommendations for patients with inherited cancer syndromes (such as Lynch) and in patients with IBD (Crohn's, Ulcerative Colitis).</p>

	<b>Depression</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. Screen all adults for depression if there is staff-assisted depression care support for regular follow-up (which HMC has). Here is an online <a href="http://www.ecentreclinic.org/index.php/depression-test">PHQ-9</a> or if you would rather have a <a href="http://www.phqscreeners.com/">printable version in many languages.</a></p>

    <b>Diabetes Mellitus</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. Screen all adults with BP greater than 135/80 (or if on antihypertensives).</p>

	<b>Elder Abuse</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. Screen for abuse in elderly adults</p>

	<b>Fall Prevention</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. Screen patient's who are 65 or older for increased risk of falls. High risk for falls includes history of falls, mobility problems, and poor score on the timed <a href="http://www.fallpreventiontaskforce.org/pdf/TimedUpandGoTest.pdf">Get-Up-and-Go test</a>. Those patients at increased risk should have two interventions: First, they should get balance and gait training either through Physical Therapy or a Community Exercise program.  Secondly, they should be prescribed 800 IU/day of Vitamin D, as it has been shown to decrease falls in RTCs.</p>

	<b>Folic Acid</b>

<p>Grade A recommendation. All women planning or capable of pregnancy should take a daily supplement of 0.4 to 0.8 mg of folic acid to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.</p>

	<b>Gonorrhea</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. Screen all sexually active women if they are at increased risk for infection. This includes young age, a previous history of STIs, new or multiple partners, sex work, drug uses, or inconsistent condom use.</p>

	<b>Hepatitis C</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. Screen all adults born between 1945 and 1965 and any injection drug users. Less common risk factors that deserve screening include anyone that received a blood transfusion before 1992, anyone on long term hemodialysis, being born to an HCV-infected mother, incarceration, intranasal drug use, percutaneous blood exposure, and getting a "homemade" tattoo.</p>

	<b>HIV</b>

<p>Grade A recommendation. All adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 should be screened once.  Those younger or older than that age range should also be screened if they are at higher risk (e.g.: IVDU, older adult with multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex).  Repeat testing is recommended if the patient has ongoing risk factors.</p>

	<b>Hypertension</b>

<p>Grade A recommendation. Everyone above age 18 should have their BP checked.  Repeat at a minimum every 2 years if their blood pressure is less than 120/80 mmHg, and every year if systolic blood pressure is 120 to 139 mmHg or diastolic is 80 to 90 mmHg.</p>

	<b>Intimate Partner Violence</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. Screen for abuse in all women of childbearing age</p>

	<b>Lipids</b>

<p>This one is a little complicated. It is a grade A recommendation that all men should have lipids tested after age 35.  Women should have them tested at age 45 only if there is increased risk of coronary artery disease (defined as tobacco use, DM, obesity, family history, HTN).  Repeat testing should be done probably every 5 years if things are normal, or more frequently if their lipids are borderline. It is a grade B recommendation for men aged 20 to 34 with increased risk for CAD (usual risk factors) and for women aged 20-44 with increased CAD risk factors.</p>

    <b>Lung Cancer</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. For patients aged 55 to 80, who have a thirty pack year smoking history, who are currently smoking or quit less than 15 years ago, who could tolerate lung surgery, and don't have shortened life span from another proces, the USPSTF now recommends yearly low radiation chest CT for the screening of lung cancer. Screening should stop once 15 or more years elapse from smoking cessation.</p>

    <b>Mammography</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation.  The USPSTF recommends biennial (every two years) mammography in all women aged 50 to 74.  Women with a genetic mutation or previous history of chest radiation have different recommendations.</p>

	<b>Nutrition and Diet</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. USPSTF recommends referral to a nutritionist for dietary counseling all adult patients with hyperlipidemia or other risk factors for CVD, or any other diet related chronic disease.</p>

	<b>Obesity</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. Screen all adults, those with BMI greater than 30 should come up with a plan for weight loss. The best data seems to be those that are intensive (12-26 sessions/year) and comprehensive (exercise, dieting, group sessions).</p>

	<b>Osteoporosis</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. Screen all women greater than 65 years of age. In addition, screen women greater than 50 years of age whose risk of a major osteoporotic fracture is greater than 9.3% over 10 years (which the baseline risk for a normal 65 year old woman). You can use the <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/index.aspx">FRAX Tool</a> to calculate this risk, note that there are different links based on ethnicity. Consider screening men who are at high risk as well (glucocorticoids, anti-epileptic medications).</p>

	<b>Sexually Transmitted Infections</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. Counsel high risk sexually active adults about safe sex practices.</p>

	<b>Sun Exposure</b>

<p>Grade B recommendation. The USPSTF recommends discussing sun block use, avoiding tanning in all patients with fair skin or who burn easily between the ages of 10 and 24 to prevent skin cancer.</p>

	<b>Syphilis</b>

<p>It is a Grade A recommendation for all people at increased risk for syphilis (men who have sex with men and have high-risk sexual behavior, commerical sex workers, adults in correctional facilities, patient population prevalence).</p>

	<b>Tobacco</b>

<p>It is a Grade A recommendation to ask about all forms of tobacco use, and if using come up with ways to help them quit.</p>
